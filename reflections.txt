When working on the Watermelon Problem, my goal was to figure out whether a given number (the watermelon’s weight) could be split into two even parts. I kept my approach simple by focusing on two main conditions.

The first thing I did was read the user’s input and convert it into an integer using int(input().strip()). This makes sure I’m working with a clean number without any extra spaces.

Next, I thought through the logic:

A watermelon can be split into two even parts only if the total weight is even

…and it must be greater than 2, because the smallest even number that can be split into two positive even numbers is 4.

So in my code, I used an if statement to check both conditions:

w > 2

w % 2 == 0 (which means the number is even)

If both conditions are true, the program prints "YES". If not, it prints "NO".

Overall, my approach was to break the problem into small, clear steps:

Read the input.

Think through the rules.

Translate those rules into simple conditions.

This helped me write a clean and understandable solution that matches what the problem is asking for.
